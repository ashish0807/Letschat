LetsChat is Real-time chat-app developed using MERN + Socket.io + tailwind CSS + Daisyui
As we know in MERN, we have used MongoDB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js
For styling and better User interface, we have used Tailwind CSS + Daisyui(it is React.js Library)
Using Socket.io, we have integrated its Real-time chat feature
In this, you can see whether your friend is online or not, because of Socket.io and React Context
We have used Zustand for the Global State Management
